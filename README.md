## Information

The Landing Page is a dynamic multi-section page with functionality built primarily with javascript. It converts the static HTML/CSS into a more interactive and user friendly page by improving usability such as better navigation, a little bit of transition animation, etc.

Javascript is used to manipulate the DOM and add logic to the page. It takes advantage of ES6 syntax as well as aim to be efficiently written.
